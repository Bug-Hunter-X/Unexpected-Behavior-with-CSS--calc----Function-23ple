To solve the issues with `calc()`, ensure that:

1. **Context for Percentages:** When using percentages in `calc()`, make sure the parent element has a defined width or height.  If the parent's dimensions are dynamic, consider using alternative approaches, such as JavaScript, to dynamically calculate the values.

2. **Unit Compatibility:** Ensure that the units used in `calc()` are compatible. Mixing percentages with fixed units like pixels directly can lead to inconsistent results. Stick to one unit type per calculation or use explicit unit conversions.

Here's an example of a more robust approach:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px; /* Defined width for percentage calculation */
}

.element {
  width: calc(50% + 10px);
}

.another-element {
  width: calc(100px + 50%); /* Might cause issues, better to use consistent units */
}

.better-element {
  width: calc(100px + 500px * 0.5); /* Safer way to handle mixed unit issue */
}
```

By carefully considering the context and unit compatibility within your `calc()` expressions, you can prevent unexpected behavior and ensure your CSS styles work consistently.
