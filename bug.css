The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there might be issues if the calculation involves percentages and the context is not well defined. For example:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% + 10px);
}
```

If the parent element of `.element` does not have a defined width, the calculation might not work as expected because the percentage will be relative to the parent's width, and that's undefined.

Another example is the use of units within `calc()` which might lead to unexpected results if not handled properly. Using different units might cause unexpected behavior if they are not compatible.

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 50%);
}
```
