# Unexpected Behavior with CSS `calc()` Function

This repository demonstrates some uncommon issues that can arise when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  The `calc()` function, while powerful for dynamic styling, can produce unexpected results if not used carefully, particularly when dealing with percentages and mixed units.

## Bug Report

The primary problem showcased is the behavior of `calc()` when percentages are used within a context where the parent element's dimensions are not defined or are dynamic.  Mixing units within a single `calc()` expression can also lead to unexpected outcomes.

## Solution

The solution focuses on ensuring that proper context exists for percentage calculations and utilizing compatible units when performing calculations within `calc()`.  Consider alternative approaches when faced with ambiguities that could lead to unpredictable behavior.
